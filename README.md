## Description

The module provides Bolt plans arround the installation of Puppet Remediate. Remediate is shipped as a bunch of docker containers. 

The installation process needs several files from the internet. Puppet modules will be downloaded, Docker will be installed and docker-compose as well. Please make sure internet access is possible on your computer running the Bolt plan and on the server installing Remediate.

## System requirements

Remediate has its own system requirements. Before you begin to install, please check the [system requirements](https://puppet.com/docs/remediate/latest/system_requirements.html). This module can check the system requirements and stop the installation if the requirements are not met. Additionally there's a plan for checking only the requirements and printing log messaged if some requirements are not met.

Bolt uses winrm transport to connect to the Windows boxes. Please make sure the Windows boxes have winrm enabled and firewalls are configured to grant access to the winrm ports on the Windows boxes.

## License

Remediate needs a license flle to run. You can apply for a test license at [licenses.puppet.com](https://licenses.puppet.com). To get a license please follow these instructions:

- Click 'Get License'
- Click '30-day Free Trial'
- Download your license (json file)
- Save your license to the directory where the installer can access it

## Before you start

Clone this module from [Github](https://github.com/tom-krieger/remediate_install.git) and follow the instructions below. 

```puppet
cd remediate_install

# install all Puppet modules needed
bolt puppetfile install

# upload your Remediate license to remote host
bolt file upload /tmp/license.json /tmp/license.json -n <host> --user <user> \
          [--private_key <private key file>] [--password] --no-host-key-check

# Windows box
bolt file upload /tmp/license.json c:\license.json -n <host> \
          --user Administrator --password <password> --transport winrm --no-ssl
```

This step will install all needed Puppet modules into the remediate_install modules folder. You can see which modules will be installed by having a look into the Puppetfile in the module.

## Usage

This module contains two Bolt plans. One plan is for simply checking the system requirements. The second plan is for installing Remediate on your system.

### Checking system requirements

```puppet
# Unix
bolt plan run remediate_install::check_requirements -n <host> --run-as root --user <user> \
          [--private_key <path to privare-key>] [--password] --no-host-key-check

# Windows
bolt plan run remediate_install::check_requirements -n <host> --user Administrator \
           --password <password> --transport winrm --no-ssl
```

### Installing Remediate

#### Unix systems
```puppet
bolt plan run remediate_install install_docker=y init_swarm=y license_file=/tmp/license.json \
          install_compose=y install_remediate=y configure_firewall=y -n <host> --run-as root \
          --user <user> [--private_key <path to privare-key>] [--password] --no-host-key-check \
          [--sudo-password [PASSWORD]]
````

#### Windows systems

```puppet
bolt plan run remediate_install install_docker=y docker_ee=true init_swarm=y \
          license_file=c:\license.json \
          install_compose=y install_remediate=y configure_firewall=y -n <host> --no-ssl \
          --user Administrator --password <password> --transport winrm
```

The installer will copy the license file into the Remediate installation directoy and will download the requierd docker compose file to fire up Remediate.
